Simple MLP neural network currently being built to train on a dataset of 28*28 images.

Specifications:
- Using ReLU activation
- Using softmax and multiclass cross entropy loss for last layer and cost function
- Using NumPY for calculations
- Currently has 1 hidden layer of 100 neurons
- Achieved 95% test accuracy on unseen data using MNIST dataset

Requirements:
- Numpy (For the bulk of the calculations, I am using numpy matrices)
- Idx2numpy (I am using this to convert the MNIST data to numpy arrays easily, I'm sure there are other ways but this way works well for me)
- MatPlotLib (Currently I am using this to visualise the predictions once they have been made)
